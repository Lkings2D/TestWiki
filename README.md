# Game Wiki Website

A **static wiki-style website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for organizing and maintaining game content.

This project demonstrates skills in **web content management and front-end development**, including:

- **Maintaining and updating content**: Organizing pages, images, and resources for easy navigation.  
- **Dynamic content loading**: Uses JavaScript to load page sections without a backend.  
- **Single-page navigation**: Smooth transitions between wiki sections using browser history (`pushState`/`popstate`).  
- **Responsive design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Asset management**: Ensures images and media are correctly linked and displayed.  

## Features

- **Dynamic content injection**: Only loads the necessary HTML for each page section.  
- **History navigation support**: Back/forward browser buttons work seamlessly.  
- **Scroll memory**: Remembers scroll positions for long pages.  
- **Path normalization**: Ensures images load correctly even on page refresh.  

## Technologies Used
