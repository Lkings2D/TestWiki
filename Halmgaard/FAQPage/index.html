                <summary>What is automation, and why is it prohibited?</summary>
                <div class="skull-details-content">
                    <p><strong>Automation</strong> refers to the use of scripts, macros, bots, or third-party tools that perform actions without direct, real-time player input.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This includes (but is not limited to):</p>
                    <ul class="combat-list">

                        <li>Combat or skill routines</li>
                        <li>Any system that reduces or removes active player control</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Automation is prohibited because it creates an unfair advantage and undermines the integrity of the game environment.</p>

            <p>There are three primary ways to train skills. Each method has a different training efficiency, which affects how much experience is gained per successful action.</p>

            <div class="training-grid" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <div class="training-method pve">
                    <h4>🪓 PvE Combat Training <span class="efficiency" style="font-size: 0.9em;">(100% Efficiency)</span></h4>
                    <p>Engage monsters, creatures, and NPCs throughout the game world. This is the standard training method and provides full experience for all valid actions. It is ideal for players who want to progress naturally while exploring, questing, and looting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="training-method pvp">
                    <h4>⚔️ PvP Combat Training <span class="efficiency" style="font-size: 0.9em;">(120% Efficiency)</span></h4>
                    <p>Engage in combat with other players. PvP training provides increased experience gains, rewarding players who take on the unpredictability of human opponents. This method carries higher risk and generally requires more frequent healing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="training-method dummy">
                    <h4>🏋️ Training Dummies <span class="efficiency" style="font-size: 0.9em;">(75% Efficiency – Gold Account Only)</span></h4>
                    <p>Training dummies are available exclusively to <strong>Gold Account</strong> players. They allow for continuous, passive skill training and grant 75% of normal experience. While slower than active combat, this method is ideal for background or extended training sessions.</p>
