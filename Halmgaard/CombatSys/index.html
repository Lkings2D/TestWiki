            <div class="vocation-card knight">
                <h4>🛡️ Knight – Master of Melee Combat & Blocking Skills</h4>
                <p>Knights are disciplined warriors trained in close-quarters combat. Wielding swords, axes, or other melee weapons, they rely on strength and resilience to overpower foes. Knights gain experience primarily in <strong>Melee</strong>, allowing them to unlock powerful strike combos, stuns, and heavy armor techniques. By using <strong>Shields</strong>, Knights gain the strongest ability to Block creatures, with stronger shields giving an increased Blocking ability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="vocation-card archer">
                <h4>🏹 Archer – Precision Ranged Specialist & Damage Avoidance Expert</h4>
                <p>Archers are agile and deadly at a distance, using bows, crossbows, or throwing weapons to eliminate enemies before they close in. Their primary skill is <strong>Accuracy</strong>, which improves their damage, critical hit chance, and ability to target enemy weak points.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="vocation-card sorcerer">
                <h4>🔮 Sorcerer – Weaver of Arcane Power & Magical Area Spells</h4>
                <p>Sorcerers channel magical forces to attack, control, and manipulate the battlefield. They specialize in <strong>Magic</strong>, gaining access to wands, magical tomes, elemental spells, and area attacks. Sorcerers improve their <strong>Magic</strong> skill at the same rate as Knights and Archers improve theirs, maintaining balance across professions.</p>

            <h2>📊 Skill Growth and Balance</h2>
            <p>All professions progress <strong>equally</strong> in their core combat skill:</p>
            <ul>
            <hr class="combat-divider">

            <h3 class="combat-section-title">💪 Earning Skill Experience</h3>
            <p>Skills progress through <strong>active use</strong>, rewarding you for how you play. Each profession gains experience in their primary skill—<strong>Melee</strong>, <strong>Accuracy</strong>, or <strong>Magic</strong>—as well as <strong>Shielding</strong>, by performing relevant actions during gameplay:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Melee:</strong> Landing hits with melee weapons or spells in the Melee category.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Striking enemies with ranged weapons or spells in the Accuracy category.</li>
                <li><strong>Magic:</strong> Dealing damage to enemies with a magic weapon or casting spells in the Magic category.</li>
                <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> Receiving attempted strikes from enemies.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr class="combat-divider">

            <h3 class="combat-section-title">📈 Experience Curve</h3>
            <p>Skill advancement follows an <strong>experience curve</strong>. As your skill level increases, the amount of experience required to reach the next level also grows. Early levels rise quickly, helping new players feel momentum, while higher levels demand greater consistency and challenge. This ensures long-term growth without artificial caps.</p>
            <p class="info-box note"><strong>💡 No Level Caps:</strong> Your character's skills can continue to improve indefinitely—if you're committed enough to train them.</p>

            <h3 class="combat-section-title">🎓 Training Methods & Efficiency</h3>
            <p>There are three main ways to train your skills, each with its own <strong>training efficiency</strong>—how much experience you earn per successful action.</p>

            <div class="training-grid">
                <div class="training-method pve">
                    <h4>🪓 PvE Combat Training <span class="efficiency" style="font-size: 0.9em;">(100% Efficiency)</span></h4>
                    <p>Engage with monsters, creatures, and NPCs in the game world. This is the <strong>standard training method</strong> and yields <strong>full experience</strong> for all valid actions. Ideal for adventurers who want to level up while exploring, questing, and looting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="training-method pvp">
                    <h4>⚔️ PvP Combat Training <span class="efficiency" style="font-size: 0.9em;">(120% Efficiency)</span></h4>
                    <p>Training with other players. PvP offers <strong>enhanced experience gains</strong>, rewarding players who take on the unpredictable challenge of human opponents. However, PvP carries more risk and will require you to heal your character more often.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="training-method dummy">
                    <h4>🏋️ Training Dummies <span class="efficiency" style="font-size: 0.9em;">(75% Efficiency – Gold Account Only)</span></h4>
                    <p>Available exclusively to Gold Account players, training dummies provide 24/7 access to passive skill development. This method grants 75% of normal experience, making it a slower option but highly convenient for background training or overnight sessions.</p>
